# Xio’s Fresh Tomatoes

* What is this website about?

* Xio’s Fresh Tomatoes * is my first website project to showcase the skills learned during my Web Development course. The website gives recommendations on movies, tv shows and books. The name for the site is a nod to the famous Rotten Tomatoes. This was a great project to create as it allowed me use my styling skills and share my personal recommendations on things I have watched or read this year.

* Interactive features

You can watch trailers for each recommendation by clicking anywhere on the image or the text below it:

You can save a link to the Saved for later pages or mark a recommendation as LIKED:

This is how the Saved for Later page looks after saving a link:
